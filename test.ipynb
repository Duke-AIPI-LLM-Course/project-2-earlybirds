In particular,  Pf phages organize P. aeruginosa biofilms into liquid crystals, promoting cellular aggregation, and enhancing resistance to environmental stressors and antibiotics, thereby contributing to bacterial persistence in chronic infections.

Dzau Distinguished Lecture in Global Health and Alumni Reception\\\\nFor more than three decades, Dr. Jim Yong Kim worked alongside global health visionary and Duke alumnus Dr. Paul Farmer to deliver healthcare to some of the world\\'s poorest and most vulnerable citizens. But that mission did not end with Farmer\\'s death in 2022. In the 2025 Victor J. Dzau Distinguished Lecture in Global Health, Kim will share reflections from his 40-year career in global health, which began when he co-founded Partners in Health with Farmer in 1987 and includes seven years as president of the World Bank Group. Kim, whose current leadership roles include serving as chancellor of the University of Global Health Equity in Rwanda, will discuss the critical work that remains to bring high-quality healthcare to every global citizen, and how emerging challenges such as climate change and the growing crisis in mental health require a renewed commitment to Farmer\\'s vision of global health equity. \\\\n\\\\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\\\\nA physician and anthropologist, Dr. Kim\\'s career has revolved around health, education, and improving the lives of the poor. He is vice chairman and partner of Global Infrastructure Partners, a fund that invests in infrastructure projects across the world. He served as president of the World Bank Group from 2012 to 2019, overseeing unprecedented investment in development priorities aimed at ending extreme poverty and boosting global prosperity. \\\\n\\\\nBefore joining the World Bank Group, Kim served as president of Dartmouth College and held professorships at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health. From 2003 to 2005, he served as director of the World Health Organization\\'s HIV/AIDS department. He led WHO\\'s \\\\\"3 by 5\\\\\" initiative, the first-ever global goal for AIDS treatment, which greatly expanded access to antiretroviral medication in developing countries. \\\\n\\\\nA recipient of the MacArthur Foundation\\'s genius fellowship, Kim was named by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2022, he was named to succeed Farmer as chancellor of the University of Global Health Eqquity, a Rwanda-based institution launched by Partners in Health and the Rwandan government to advance medical training and research across sub-Saharan Africa. \\\\n\\\\nFor more information about the event, please follow this link:\\\\nhttps://globalhealth.duke.edu/events/paul-farmer-and-unfinished-agenda-global-health-equity-conversation-dr-jim-yong-kim\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Duke Global Health Institute (DGHI)\",\"co_sponsors\":null,\"location\":{\"address\":\"Karsh Alumni and Visitors Center\",\"link\":\"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=395\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"Shepard, Kaitlyn\",\"email\":\"kaitlyn.shepard@duke.edu\",\"phone\":\"(910) 338-8598\"},\"categories\":[\"Global\",\"Lecture/Talk\",\"Free Food and Beverages\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0195-fd0a2ac6-00004ae8demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":\"https://globalhealth.duke.edu/events/paul-farmer-and-unfinished-agenda-global-health-equity-conversation-dr-jim-yong-kim\",\"submitted_by\":[\"kns70\"],\"presenter\":\"Dr. Jim Yong Kim\",\"image\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2025/20250415/bf8caeabbd94feca6d0e4c3e43295284-CR-Paul Farmer and the Unfinished Agenda for Global Health Equity - v1 (3)_20250403070416PM.png\",\"image_alt_text\":\"Paul Farmer and the Unfinished Agenda for Global Health Equity: A Conversation with Dr. Jim Yong Kim\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0194-3d9eb82f-000058e6demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-04-15T21:30:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-04-15T22:30:00Z\",\"summary\":\"Resident Grand Rounds\",\"description\":\"Join us for Resident Grand Rounds! \\\\n\\\\nEligible for 1 hour of CME credit.\\\\n\\\\nRegister: https://duke.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUkfuCurD4sEtDyaQbq2OXkwnkwhzTusYgX\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Duke Eye Center\",\"co_sponsors\":[\"Department of Ophthalmology\"],\"location\":{\"address\":\"Duke Eye Center - Albert Eye Research Institute Auditorium\",\"link\":\"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=47\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"Duke Eye Center\",\"email\":\"dukeeyeevents@duke.edu\"},\"categories\":[\"Medicine\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0194-3d9eb82f-000058e6demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":\"https://duke.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUkfuCurD4sEtDyaQbq2OXkwnkwhzTusYgX\",\"submitted_by\":[\"jc833\"],\"image\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2025/20250415/edd00b5874cc45cabb0caadc39cbfc72-CR-2_20250114061545PM.png\",\"image_alt_text\":\"GR icon\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0194-dc1fb8ab-000013b4demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-04-15T21:30:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-04-15T23:00:00Z\",\"summary\":\"Mentorship and Research Integrity: Discussions for mentors and mentees\",\"description\":\"\\\\u003cb\\\\u003eREGISTRATION\\\\u003c/b\\\\u003e: \\\\u003ca href=\\\\\"https://duke.is/n/7zmm\\\\\" target=\\\\\"_blank\\\\\"\\\\u003eClick Here\\\\u003c/a\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u003ci\\\\u003eNOTE: Registration closes 24 hours before event start.

In additive manufacturing (AM), the fabrication of parts and objects with high complexity and high performance is advantageous over other methods. Using nanocomposites enables highly improved properties even with \\\\\"commodity polymers\\\\\" that do not need to undergo high-temperature processes or extensive reformulation. With artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), optimizing the formulation and manufacturing methods is possible. Using sensors capable of a feedback loop mechanism and the ability to use simulation to create digital twins, optimizing properties in record time is possible. Statistical and logic-derived design, including regression analysis, are starting points for designing experiments (DOE) or principal component analysis(PCA) in optimization and analysis vs trial-and-error approaches when working with polymer materials. In this talk, we demonstrate the approaches toward understanding Nanostructuring in composites and hierarchical approaches in optimization via AI/ML and other training/learning sets for specific properties and applications, such as 3D printing and flow chemistry reactions. Introducing more sensors (monitoring instruments) in AM processes and real-time ML with online monitoring allows a feedback loop and deep learning (DL) for autonomous fabrication and data analytics.\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Duke Materials Initiative\",\"co_sponsors\":[\"Biology\",\"Biomedical Engineering (BME)\",\"Cell Biology\",\"Chemistry\",\"Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)\",\"Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)\",\"Mathematics\",\"Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science (MEMS)\",\"Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability\",\"Physics\",\"Pratt School of Engineering\",\"Trinity College\"],\"location\":{\"address\":\"Fitzpatrick Center Schiciano Auditorium Side B, room 1466\",\"link\":\"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=98\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"Liana Igescu\",\"email\":\"liana.igescu@duke.edu\"},\"categories\":[\"Engineering\",\"Panel/Seminar/Colloquium\",\"Research\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0193-bc0a9e4b-0000183ademobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":null,\"submitted_by\":[\"lmi3\"],\"presenter\":\"Rigoberto Advincula\",\"image\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2025/20250416/8fcca46f6d3588a349cc494d525c26fb-CR-Untitled design_duke calendar_20250213045531PM.png\",\"image_alt_text\":\"speaker headshoot\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0195-1a32d603-00007d8ademobedework@mysite.edu\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-04-16T16:00:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-04-16T17:00:00Z\",\"summary\":\"Joint NC BERD Seminar: Survival Analysis\",\"description\":\"This session will present an introduction to survival analysis including fundamental statistical concepts and approaches for analyzing outcome data in the form of time-to-occurrence of an event.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRegistration link: https://redcap.wakehealth.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=KEM43P83TWRC4HJY\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis event is being cross-promoted by the NC BERD Consortium, a collaboration of the CTSA-funded BERD cores at UNC-Chapel Hill, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and Duke University School of Medicine.\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Biostatistics and Bioinformatics\",\"co_sponsors\":[\"BERD Core\",\"Duke Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI)\",\"School of Medicine (SOM)\"],\"location\":{\"address\":\"Virtual\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"BERD Methods Core\",\"email\":\"berdcore@duke.edu\"},\"categories\":[\"Lecture/Talk\",\"Panel/Seminar/Colloquium\",\"Conference/Symposium\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0195-1a32d603-00007d8ademobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":null,\"submitted_by\":[\"llr27\"],\"presenter\":\"Mitchell Paukner, PhD\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0196-10c149f0-00000725demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-04-16T16:00:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-04-16T17:00:00Z\",\"summary\":\"FIP VIRTUAL Seminar \\\\\"Computational adaptive optics and super resolution imaging with nonlinear holographic microscopy\\\\\"\",\"description\":\"NOTE: This is a makeup Virtual Seminar due to a snow day on 2/19. \\\\n\\\\nOptical microscopy plays a pivotal role in the understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of biological systems and for probing material systems. Light interacts gently with biological systems, which makes imaging extremely powerful for observing living systems. As a result, optical microscopy enables everything from the discovery of basic biological processes to the ability to diagnose disease to the discovery of new materials. Optical microscopy is primarily bound by three limits: spatial resolution, molecular specificity of imaging targets, and imaging depth in tissue. My group develops new methods for extracting a greater range of information from optical microscopy. I will discuss several aspects of computational imaging with widefield nonlinear microscopy using second harmonic generation (SHG), third harmonic generation (THG), and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS). These imaging methods are extremely useful for imaging studies ranging from biological samples to novel material systems. In biological samples, SHG, THG, and CARS signal generation is dominated by signals from collagen in the extracellular matrix and from muscle fibers. I will discuss computational adaptive optics for SHG and THG holographic imaging. In addition, I will discuss a new widefield computational super resolution CARS microscopy that offers a powerful new approach to vibrational spectroscopic imaging. \\\\n\\\\nRandy A.

This month, we are featuring Duke faculty member Wilkins Aquino. Abstract below:\\\\nArterial stiffness is a critical indicator of cardiovascular health. To noninvasively assess arterial health, we utilize arterial dispersion ultrasound vibrometry (ADUV), where an acoustic radiation force (ARF) generates propagating waves in the arterial wall, measured through ultrasound. A persistent challenge in this domain is developing a fast and reliable method to map these wave measurements to arterial health metrics. In response, we propose an end-to-end classification framework that directly links ADUV data to arterial health assessment. Key contributions of our approach include effective handling of high-dimensional signals, optimal feature selection for interpretability, and the training of efficient classifiers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our ADUV-based machine learning framework across cohorts, including healthy individuals, patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and those with cardiovascular risk factors (CVDRF).\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Pratt School of Engineering\",\"co_sponsors\":[\"Biomedical Engineering (BME)\"],\"location\":{\"address\":\"Virtual Event Zoom Link\",\"link\":\"https://duke.is/CompHealth-April-Seminar\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"Marnie Rhoads\",\"email\":\"marnie.rhoads@duke.edu\"},\"categories\":[\"Medicine\",\"Engineering\",\"Lecture/Talk\",\"Research\",\"Technology\",\"Webcast\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0195-c898c404-00003d2ddemobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":\"https://duke.is/CompHealth-April-Seminar\",\"submitted_by\":[\"mr101\"],\"series-name\":\"Computational Health Seminar Series\",\"presenter\":\"Wilkins Aquino\",\"image\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2025/20250416/5883aad9dd8fbaf4fd86a65593288d97-CR-Aquino_CompHealth April 530x353_20250324024009PM.png\",\"image_alt_text\":\"Event Advertisement\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0193-d56e41d9-00000e1ademobedework@mysite.edu_20250416T180000Z\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-04-16T18:00:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-04-16T19:00:00Z\",\"summary\":\"Bars with Bonner\",\"description\":\"Open office hours for all HPE students to have an opportunity to chat and/or share a concern.  \\\\n\\\\nPlease stop by and grab a snack too!\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"School of Medicine (SOM)\",\"co_sponsors\":null,\"location\":{\"address\":\"Level 2 seating area | TSC Bldg.\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"Grossman, Victoria\",\"email\":\"victoria.grossman@duke.edu\",\"phone\":\"919-684-7952\"},\"categories\":null,\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0193-d56e41d9-00000e1ademobedework@mysite.edu_20250416T180000Z\",\"event_url\":null,\"submitted_by\":[\"grosm001\"],\"series-name\":\"Granola with Gagliardi_TSC\",\"presenter\":\"Dr. Melanie Bonner\",\"image\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2025/20250416/a0e00d5dc9eb3bf68d434fb06a2880be-CR-LeWell-Vert-CMYK (1)_20241217042312PM.jpg\",\"image_alt_text\":\"Le Well logo\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0194-a93b3aad-0000569ademobedework@mysite.edu\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-04-16T19:00:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-04-16T20:00:00Z\",\"summary\":\"Study Abroad Duke-Approved Workshop\",\"description\":\"Join GEO staff for an informative workshop on Duke-Approved study abroad programs.

Gut microbiota can directly affect chemicals through xenobiotic metabolism, or indirectly by providing metabolites that can alter host metabolism and chemical susceptibility. Further, the intestinal tract is lined with a mucus layer that supports a barrier between gut microbiota and intestinal cells. This mucus layer can be altered due to chemical exposure but has also been shown to be disrupted in diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases. My research is investigating two potential mechanisms that could impact susceptibility to environmental chemicals using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. First, I will show how different microbiota affect mitochondrial function in C. elegans through changes in metabolite levels and metabolism. Then, I will present how changes in intestinal mucin may alter chemical uptake.  \\\\n\\\\nThis seminar will be held in person in Grainger Hall room 1112 and online via Panopto.\\\\nClick \\\\\"More Event Information\\\\\" to visit the seminar website for a link to attend virtually.\\\\nBoth attendance options are free and open to all.\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Integrated Toxicology \\\\u0026 Environmental Health (ITEHP)\",\"co_sponsors\":[\"Nicholas School of the Environment\"],\"location\":{\"address\":\"Grainger Hall room 1112 and Panopto\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"Straehle, Jessica\",\"email\":\"jessica.straehle@duke.edu\",\"phone\":\"919-613-8078\"},\"categories\":[\"Natural Sciences\",\"Health/Wellness\",\"Lecture/Talk\",\"Panel/Seminar/Colloquium\",\"Research\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0195-cd0e2ba6-00005346demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":\"https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/envhealth/seminars-symposia/spring-2025-seminar-series/april-17-2025-investigating-the-role-of-the-gut-microbiome-and-intestinal-mucin-on-mitochondrial-function-and-chemical-susceptibility-in-c-elegans/\",\"submitted_by\":[\"jls265\"],\"series-name\":\"Integrated Toxicology \\\\u0026 Environmental Health Seminar Series\",\"presenter\":\"Christina Bergemann, PhD Candidate, Duke University\",\"image\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2025/20250417/4b77e798176d1188a7d59f69aac06f88-CR-PhotoBergemann_20250325112652AM.png\",\"image_alt_text\":\"Seminar speaker, Christina Bergemann, smiling, wearing a forest green blouse and black blazer\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0195-cdca3c95-00005b34demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-04-17T16:00:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-04-17T18:00:00Z\",\"summary\":\"CDVS Workshop: Intro to Power BI: Easy interactive reports\",\"description\":\"Power BI is a dynamic data visualization tool from Microsoft that allows you to connect to data sources, structure data models, and create interactive reports.

Wells Lectureship\\\\n\\\\nDr. Choi-Kain is currently the Director of the Gunderson Personality Disorders Institute (GPDI), an internationally recognized center of training for empirically supported treatments for borderline personality disorder (BPD) and research on outcomes as well as the social cognitive mechanisms targeted in these interventions. Her research training began as a post-doctoral fellow under the supervision of John Gunderson, M.D. After three years of research training, Dr. Choi-Kain developed an intensive residential treatment program, the Gunderson Residence, combining various empirically supported therapies with a milieu setting emphasizing rehabilitation of social and occupational functioning. At the same time, she expanded and diversified McLean Hospital\\'s adult BPD treatment program to include mentalization-based treatment (MBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)/DBT for PTSD training clinics as outpatient programs, to both train clinicians in these approaches while also providing insurance-based care. She has written three books on various applications of Gunderson\\'s Good Psychiatric Management (GPM) adapted to different levels of care, clinical professionals, age groups, and stepped care.

At the same time, it has shown a strong analog persistence. Japan\\'s seeming caution to fully embrace digital technology is nothing new; similar attitudes were evident in the 1980s when the country\\'s thriving electronics industry sought to capture public interest in personal computers. Japanese society\\'s slow adoption of PCs-and subsequently, PC-based internet-has left many scholars scratching their heads. With disposable income being one of the strongest predictors of technology diffusion, the Japanese had some of the deepest pockets in the world during the 1980s.\\\\n\\\\nKang tackles this mystery by comparing Japan with another exceptional case: South Korea. This neighboring country has been considered an outlier for the opposite reason-its people embraced computer and internet technologies surprisingly quickly, despite having a significantly lower income level than Japan. What explains these contrasting attitudes toward computers and the internet?\\\\n\\\\nTo answer this question, Kang traces the evolution of media discourses surrounding computers and the internet from the 1980s to the 1990s. By analyzing and comparing PC advertisements in both countries, he examines what these new machines meant to the Japanese and Korean publics. In doing so, he reevaluates the relevance of conventional explanations, such as Japan\\'s aging population and language-input barriers. Finally, he situates his findings within broader historical and cultural contexts, exploring representations of technology in literature, film, and animation, including \\\\\"Godzilla,\\\\\" \\\\\"Astro Boy,\\\\\" and \\\\\"Galaxy Express 999.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker:\\\\nInkyu Kang is a professor of journalism and communication at Penn State University, Behrend College. Having earned his MA and PhD in Media and Cultural Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he also taught there before transitioning to Penn State. His experience extends internationally, encompassing visiting scholar positions at Rikkyo University (2024) and Saint Petersburg State University (2017). \\\\n\\\\nKang\\'s primary research interests include global media, visual semiotics, and new media technology. He is also an award-winning journalist who has written extensively about cultural and technological issues. His work has been featured in outlets such as \\\\\"The Guardian,\\\\\" \\\\\"USA Today,\\\\\" and \\\\\"Billboard Magazine.\\\\\"\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)\",\"co_sponsors\":[\"Asian \\\\u0026 Middle Eastern Studies (AMES)\"],\"location\":{\"address\":\"Rubenstein Library Breedlove Room 349\",\"link\":\"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=1872\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"Asian Pacific Studies Institute (APSI)\",\"email\":\"apsi@duke.edu\"},\"categories\":[\"Business\",\"Entrepreneurship\",\"Asia focus\",\"Global\",\"Humanities\",\"Politics\",\"Social Sciences\",\"Lecture/Talk\",\"Research\",\"Technology\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0195-0095ffe5-000076b2demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":null,\"submitted_by\":[\"rmk33\"],\"series-name\":\"APSI Speaker Series\",\"presenter\":\"Inkyu Kang (Journalism and Communication, PennState Behrend)\",\"image\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2025/20250418/7c3273db1d6f7f1e8b6e93de96b7746e-CR-250418_Kang_cal_20250213063304PM.png\",\"image_alt_text\":\"Background photo of a nighttime street scene in Japan; headshot of Inkyu Kang; descriptive text (event title, date, time, location, series, organizer)\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0194-f06a677a-00005331demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-04-18T19:00:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-04-18T21:00:00Z\",\"summary\":\"\\\\\"The Attitude of Betrayal\\\\\"\",\"description\":\"Abstract:  While philosophers sometimes identify betrayal as a reactive attitude specifically associated with broken trust, there has been relatively little sustained analysis of this attitude in the relevant literature.

We propose gIVBMA, a Bayesian model averaging procedure that addresses this challenge by averaging across different sets of instrumental variables and covariates in a structural equation model. Our approach extends previous work through a scale-invariant prior structure and accommodates non-Gaussian outcomes and treatments, offering greater flexibility than existing methods. The computational strategy uses conditional Bayes factors to update models separately for the outcome and treatments. We prove that this model selection procedure is consistent. By explicitly accounting for model uncertainty, gIVBMA allows instruments and covariates to switch roles and provides robustness against invalid instruments. In simulated and real data experiments, gIVBMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. A software implementation of gIVBMA is available in Julia. An application to returns to education will be discussed.\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Statistical Science\",\"co_sponsors\":null,\"location\":{\"address\":\"Old Chemistry 116\",\"link\":\"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=99\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"Rauch, Lori\",\"email\":\"lr3@stat.duke.edu\",\"phone\":\"684-6720\"},\"categories\":[\"Lecture/Talk\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0196-1fb320fa-00005b3fdemobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":null,\"submitted_by\":[\"lr3\"],\"presenter\":\"Mark Steel, Professor of Statistics, University of Warwick\",\"image\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2025/20250421/54b3ec39f18461e1b5fc72f830645d3b-CR-Mark.Steel-sized_20250410030745PM.jpg\",\"image_alt_text\":\"Mark Steel\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0195-d89e80ce-000037e8demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-04-21T15:45:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-04-21T17:00:00Z\",\"summary\":\" Global Inequality Research Initiative (GIRI) Capstone\",\"description\":\"The Global Inequality Research Initiative (GIRI) Capstone Event is set to take place on Monday, April 21, 2025, from 11:45 AM to 1:00 PM, in the Friedl Building Jameson Gallery (East Campus) offering a platform for students to present their semester-long research projects. \\\\n\\\\nThis semester\\'s event will feature research from students in the Inequality and Reparations course as well as the Disability Justice course.

The subsurface is inherently complex and difficult to observe, making geomechanical problems challenging to analyze both theoretically and computationally. These challenges impact engineering applications, limiting the scope of what is achievable. However, recent advancements in control theory and artificial intelligence (AI) are providing new avenues for studying and managing subsurface behavior.\\\\n\\\\nIn this talk, I will present recent advances that integrate nonlinear control theory and AI in geomechanics. In particular, I will focus on the behavior of natural and anthropogenic seismic faults, which are responsible for both natural and human-induced seismicity. Novel mathematical results [1-3,8] demonstrate how it is possible to stabilize a fault system and induce slow, aseismic slip with a predetermined velocity profile, even in the absence of detailed underground information. In other words, it is mathematically shown that earthquakes can, in theory, be prevented. These theoretical findings are supported by numerical simulations and laboratory-scale analogue experiments [4].\\\\n\\\\nGoing further, I will discuss how these insights can be applied to control human-induced seismicity in large reservoirs, potentially unlocking the Earth\\'s remarkable potential for sustainable energy production and underground energy storage [5-8]. Finally, I will highlight current progress and challenges in smart geomechanics, including real-time subsurface monitoring, optimal placement of actuators and sensors, and the development of digital twins for computational modeling. These advancements bring us closer to a future where we can actively manage and optimize subsurface behavior in real time.\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)\",\"co_sponsors\":null,\"location\":{\"address\":\"Wilkinson Building, room 021 auditorium\",\"link\":\"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=366\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"Hinz, Nicolle\",\"email\":\"nicolle.hinz@duke.edu\",\"phone\":\"832-279-0092\"},\"categories\":[\"Panel/Seminar/Colloquium\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0195-ce4ec8ea-00006d59demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":\"http://cee.duke.edu\",\"submitted_by\":[\"nh143\"],\"series-name\":\"CEE Spring Seminar Series 2025\",\"presenter\":\"Dr. Ioannis Stefanou, Professor, Centrale Nantes\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0196-16bd8233-00003a71demobedework@mysite.edu_20250422T160000Z\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-04-22T16:00:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-04-22T20:00:00Z\",\"summary\":\"Spring Plant Sale\",\"description\":\"Starting on April 14th, we\\'ll be selling seedlings for your home garden!

Mati Diop in person\",\"description\":\"DAHOMEY\\\\n(Mati Diop, 2024, 67 min, France/Senegal/Benin, French w/ English subtitles, DCP)\\\\n\\\\nThe African kingdom of Dahomey, which ruled over its region at the west of the continent until the turn of the 20th century, saw hundreds of its splendid royal artifacts plundered by French colonial troops in its waning days. Now, as 26 of these treasures are set to return to their homeland-now within the Republic of Benin-acclaimed filmmaker Mati Diop documents their voyage back. As with her layered, supernaturally tinged ATLANTICS, Diop takes a singular approach to contemporary questions around belonging in our postcolonial world, transforming this rich subject matter into a multifaceted examination of ownership and exhibition, and employing multiple points of view, including-most strikingly-those of the artifacts themselves as they sail in darkness over the ocean to their rightful home. Alternating images of nocturnal melancholy and debates among students at Benin\\'s University of Abomey-Calavi about what should be done with the objects, DAHOMEY brilliantly negotiates a lost past and an unsure present. \\\\n\\\\n-- Winner of the Golden Bear at the 2024 Berlin Film Festival\\\\n\\\\nMati Diop lives and works between Paris and Dakar. Her first feature ATLANTICS (2019) was selected in the official Competition at the Festival de Cannes, where it was awarded the Grand Prix. The film was later shortlisted as one of the 10 best international films at the Oscars. She has also directed several short-films and medium-length films: ATLANTICS (2009), SNOW CANON (2011), BIG IN VIETNAM (2012), A THOUSAND SUNS (2013), and IN MY ROOM (2020), which were also nominated and awarded in many international festivals. In 2016, Mati Diop received the Lincoln Center of New York\\'s Martin E. Segal - Emerging Artist Award.

Future missions with larger and heavier rovers will require bigger parachutes and inflatable drag devices, necessitating advanced simulations using high-fidelity, multi-disciplinary computational models for supersonic parachute inflation dynamics (SPID). These models must address complex factors, including shocks, turbulence, porous flow boundary conditions, the behavior of fabric materials, extensive contact between thin surfaces, and highly nonlinear fluid-structure interactions amid topology changes.\\\\nThis lecture presents research conducted at Stanford University in collaboration with NASA Ames and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to develop these computational models and highlights several associated innovations. Key advancements include a multi-scale approach for modeling woven fabric dynamics through locally attached microstructures and mechanics-informed machine learning, a total variation diminishing method for solving multi-material flow problems while eliminating spurious oscillations, a subgrid scale modeling technique for porous wall boundary conditions, and an energy-conserving discretization method for fluid-structure transmission interfaces of disparate spatial dimensions.\\\\nAdditionally, the lecture will report validation results from simulating the SPID of parachutes tested during NASA\\'s 2018 ASPIRE mission, which informed the parachute design selection for the Mars 2020 mission that successfully landed Perseverance on February 18, 2021.\\\\n\\\\nCHARBEL FARHAT is the Vivian Church Hoff Professor of Aircraft Structures at Stanford University\\'s School of Engineering, where he chaired the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics from 2008 to 2023.

However, the manifestation and experience of perceived racial discrimination may have changed over time, affecting those who were socialized in different eras differently. Furthermore, the way that white Americans understand and internalize racial discrimination against white people has expanded in the years since the Civil Rights era. These generational shifts may contribute to recent overall trends in mental health outcome prevalence, mental healthcare treatment seeking behavior, and deaths of despair across generations and between racial groups. In this study, I examined how perceived racial treatment relates to subjective and objective mental health indicators among non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic white adults across four generational cohorts. Preliminary results reveal that among both Black and white adults, Generation X experiences significantly higher odds of poor mental health outcomes compared to other generational cohorts. Among Black adults, for only Generation X did perceived poor racial treatment relate to poor mental health outcomes. However, among white adults, perceived worse racial treatment compared to other races was associated with worse subjective mental health outcomes for all generations. Additionally, white adults in Generation X saw an increased predicted probability of poor subjective mental health outcomes if they perceived they were treated better than other races. Better perceived treatment was also associated with higher odds of diagnosed depression across all generational cohorts among white adults.\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Duke Population Research Institute (DuPRI)\",\"co_sponsors\":null,\"location\":{\"address\":\"SSRI-Gross Hall 270\",\"link\":\"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=203\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"Simpson, Linda\",\"email\":\"linda.b.simpson@duke.edu\",\"phone\":\"919-613-9363\"},\"categories\":[\"Social Sciences\",\"Lecture/Talk\",\"Panel/Seminar/Colloquium\",\"Research\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0194-db71b8f5-000003d5demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":\"https://dupri.duke.edu/news-events/events/perceived-racial-treatment-and-mental-health-across-black-and-white-generational\",\"submitted_by\":[\"my109\"],\"series-name\":\"DUPRI Seminar Series\",\"presenter\":\"Fatima Fairfax - Duke University\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0194-db70c9e6-000003d4demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-04-24T16:00:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-04-24T17:15:00Z\",\"summary\":\"Racial Residential Segregation and Cognitive Decline Across the Life Course\",\"description\":\"Racial residential segregation is an important mechanism by which structural racism drives racial health disparities.

But it turns out that there are some big questions about traditional grading systems: Do they show what a student has (or hasn\\'t) learned? Could students \\\\\"get by\\\\\" on partial credit - or fail a class due to the formulas we use, even though they\\'ve actually learned everything we could ask? What does a mashed-up average of points and partial credit even mean? The good news is that there are better options: approaches to grading that are grounded in how humans actually learn and better represent that learning, all while upholding high standards. In this talk, you\\'ll learn the basics of alternative grading, see what works (and what doesn\\'t), identify practical ways to fit new grading practices into your classes, and find resources to help you build a grading system that actively supports learning.

Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are crucial tools to measure the accelerating expansion of the universe, today comprising thousands of SNe across multiple telescopes. Accurate measurements of cosmological parameters with SNe Ia require a robust understanding and cross-calibration of the telescopes and filters. The previous best cross-calibration effort, \\'Fragilistic\\', provided cross-calibration for 25 photometric systems, but offered no public code or ability to easily add new surveys. We aim to provide an open-source\\\\ncross-calibration solution with an eye to the future, available at https://github.com/bap37/Dovekie/ . Methods. We use the Pan-STARRs (PS1) and Gaia all-sky telescopes to characterise the measured filters from our 11 photometric\\\\nsystems, using published field stars to, for the first time, derive uncertainties on our filter measurements and modify filters to best\\\\nmatch the data. With these filters, and direct observations of a set of DA white dwarves from Boyd et al. (2024), we simultaneously\\\\ncross-calibrate our zeropoints for each filter in each photometric system, and train a new SALT model to propagate these results to\\\\ncosmology. \\\\nResults. We find improvements to the calibration systematic uncertainty of ×2 for the Pantheon+ (Brout et al. 2022) sample with a new σw(phot) = 0.011, and smaller yet still significant improvements to the DES5YR calibration uncertainty. For our Pantheon+- like sample combined with constraints from Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and the microwave background radiation, we estimate a reduction in the ΛCDM tension from previously reported 2.5σ to 2σ.\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Physics\",\"co_sponsors\":null,\"location\":{\"address\":\"Physics 298\",\"link\":\"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=94\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"Angelica Mitchell, J.D.\",\"email\":\"angelica.mitchell@duke.edu\",\"phone\":\"919-660-2510\"},\"categories\":[\"Natural Sciences\",\"Panel/Seminar/Colloquium\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a000483-92c3adf6-0195-d2e35cc0-000009fbdemobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":null,\"submitted_by\":[\"amm342\"],\"series-name\":\"Cosmology Seminar Series\",\"presenter\":\"Brodie Popovic\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a001f8a-90945c88-0190-9d2c7693-00005e79demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-05-15T20:00:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-05-15T21:00:00Z\",\"summary\":\"Duke CTPM Seminar Series - TBA\",\"description\":\"Duke CTPM Seminar Series (held on the 3rd Thursday of each month)\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Department of Anesthesiology\",\"co_sponsors\":null,\"location\":{\"address\":\"MSRBIII, Room 1125 and Via Zoom\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"Roxan Jean Mamac\",\"email\":\"roxanjean.mamac@duke.edu\"},\"categories\":[\"Medicine\",\"Panel/Seminar/Colloquium\",\"Meeting\",\"Research\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a001f8a-90945c88-0190-9d2c7693-00005e79demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":null,\"submitted_by\":[\"cgkeith\"],\"series-name\":\"Duke CTPM Seminar Series\",\"image\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2025/20250515/2535c7ae219c88e5c37e78ba55947c5a-CR-CTPM Seminar_20240709092457PM.jpg\",\"image_alt_text\":\"MSRBIII at Duke University\"},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a028b3e-88511306-0188-52f8949d-000010f8demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-05-16T04:00:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-05-16T04:00:00Z\",\"summary\":\" Drop/Add for Summer Term 1 ends (11:59 PM)\",\"description\":\"Drop/Add for Summer Term 1 ends (11:59 PM)\",\"status\":\"CONFIRMED\",\"sponsor\":\"Registrar\\'s Office\",\"co_sponsors\":null,\"location\":{\"address\":\"None\"},\"contact\":{\"name\":\"None\"},\"categories\":[\"Academic Calendar Dates\",\"Student\"],\"link\":\"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a028b3e-88511306-0188-52f8949d-000010f8demobedework@mysite.edu\",\"event_url\":null,\"submitted_by\":[\"abbj\"]},{\"id\":\"CAL-8a00048d-91324965-0191-511f2442-0000219cdemobedework@mysite.edu_20250516T130000Z\",\"start_timestamp\":\"2025-05-16T13:00:00Z\",\"end_timestamp\":\"2025-05-16T14:00:00Z\",\"summary\":\"Nephrology Grand Rounds\",\"description\":\"Nephrology Grand Rounds are the primary teaching conference of the Division of\\\\nNephrology.
